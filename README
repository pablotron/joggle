1. Overview
===========
Joggle is an Twitter to XMPP relay.  Jabber messages are sent as tweets,
and tweets are sent as instant messages.  

Installation and configuration is easy and, if you'd like, you can share
your Joggle installation with more than one person.

2. System Requirements
======================
Here's what you'll need to get started using Joggle:

  * Ruby 1.8 (a recent version, preferrably including RubyGems)
  * JSON (gem install json)
  * XMPP4r (gem install xmpp4r)

You'll also need a spare Jabber account to relay messages.  If you don't
have your own Jabber server, you can create a free one through
jabber.org or gmail.com.

3. Installation
===============
The easiest way to install Joggle is via RubyGems:

    sudo gem install joggle

If you don't use RubyGems, you can also install Joggle using setup.rb,
like this:

    sudo ruby ./setup.rb

Note: If you're using Debian or a Debian-based distribution (e.g.
Ubuntu), then you'll want to use the RubyGems version of XMPP4r -- the
Debian version is horribly out of date, and may not work with Joggle.

4. Configuration
================
The simplest way to get Joggle up and running is like so:

    # create ~/.joggle and make sure it's only readable by you
    mkdir ~/.joggle && chmod 700 ~/.joggle

    # add username and password to config
    echo 'runner.client.user joggle-example@example.com' > ~/.joggle/joggle.cfg
    echo 'runner.client.pass s3kr3t_' > ~/.joggle/joggle.cfg

    # run joggle
    joggle --config ~/.joggle/joggle.cfg

Want to run Joggle via Cron?  Here's how:

    # run joggle every time the system is restarted
    @reboot joggle --daemon --config  ~/.joggle/joggle.cfg

Note: Although you can specify the JID and password via the command-line
or the environment, doing so is not recommended on a shared system; see
the "Security Considerations" section below for additional information.

5. Using Joggle
===============
In order to use Joggle you'll need to bind your Jabber account to your
twitter account.  Here's how:

 1. Add the Joggle Jabber ID to your IM client (e.g.
    joggle-example@example.com in the examples above).

 2. Register your Twitter account with Joggle by sending a 
    message to Joggle in the following form:

    ".register TWITTER_USER TWITTER_PASS"

    (replace TWITTER_USER and TWITTER_PASS with your Twitter username
    and password, respectively)

Note that more than one person can use the Joggle Jabber relay.  Each
person just needs to follow the steps above to bind their Jabber and
Twitter accounts (this feature can be disabled; see the "Advanced
Configuration" section below).  At the moment you can only register one
Twitter account per person, although this may change in the future.

If you change your mind and decide not to use Joggle any more, you can
tell it to forget your Twitter account information by sending a message
like this:

    ".unregister"

There are several other commands available via message as well; use the
".help" command for a complete list.

6. Advanced Configuration
=========================
By default, Joggle will automatically approve any Jabber subscription
request it receives.  This means that if Joggle is relaying via an
account on a public Jabber server, then anyone can use your Joggle
installation to relay to Twitter.

To limit your Joggle installation to a specific set of Jabber IDs,
use the --allow command-line option, like so:

    # limit joggle access to specific users
    joggle --allow alice@example.com --allow bob@example.com

Or you can use the 'engine.allow' directive in the configuration file:

    # limit access to alice@example.com and bob@example.com
    engine.allow alice@example.com
    engine.allow bob@example.com

You can also configure the Joggle update frequency.  Here's what the
configuration looks like by default:

    # from 8am until 3pm, update every 10 minutes
    engine.update.range    8-15       10

    # from 3pm until 10pm, update every 5 minutes
    engine.update.range    15-22      10

    # from 10pm until midnight, update every 10 minutes
    engine.update.range    22-24      10 

    # from midnight until 2am, update every 20 minutes
    engine.update.range    0-2        20 

    # for unspecified times (e.g. 2am - 8am), update every 60 minutes
    engine.update.default             60

Note that the _minimum_ update frequency is 5 minutes; Joggle will
ignore anything less than that.  Also note that HTTP caching and a
number of other checks are performed prior to contacting Twitter, so
the specified update frequency will probably not translate precisely
into the actual update frequency.

There are several other command-line options, environment varialbes, and
configuration file directives.  These will be documented on the Joggle
web site (http://pablotron.org/software/joggle/) when time permits.

7. Security Considerations
==========================
Since Joggle is saves your Twitter username and password, an unsavory
system administrator or malicious user could obtain both by sifting
through the Joggle storage or log files.

By default, Joggle does its best to protect against malicious users by
creating the storage and log files in a directory that only accessible
by the owner (chmod 700).  

The implications here are as follows:

  * Don't use a Joggle relay run by someone you don't trust.

  * Don't run a Joggle relay on a system that isn't secure.

  * Don't change the path for the configuration, storage, or log files, 
    without properly securing the new location (e.g. chmod 700).

  * Don't specify the username and password via the command-line on a
    shared system, since the command-line arguments can be viewed by
    other users (e.g. "ps axu")

You should also be wary of your Jabber providers; many Jabber servers of
them do not configure Jabber with TLS or SASL enabled, which means that
both your Jabber and Twitter credentials are sent over the wire as plain
text.

Joggle connects to Twitter via SSL.  If you're having problems with SSL,
you can disable this feature by adding the following directives to your
config file:

  # use http instead of https for Twitter updates
  # (do not do this unless you have to)
  twitter.fetcher.url.timeline  http://twitter.com/statuses/friends_timeline.json
  twitter.fetcher.url.tweet     http://twitter.com/statuses/update.json

Note that doing this is NOT RECOMMENDED; your Twitter username and
password will be sent over the wire as plain text.
