Overview
========
Joggle is an Twitter to XMPP relay.  Jabber messages are sent as tweets,
and tweets are sent as instant messages.  

System Requirements
===================
Here's what you'll need to get started using Joggle:

  * Required:
    - Ruby 1.8 (a recent version, including RubyGems)
    - JSON (gem install json)
    - XMPP4r (gem install xmpp4r)

  * Recommended:
    - SQLite3-Ruby (gem install sqlite3)

You'll also need a spare Jabber account to relay messages.  If you don't
have your own Jabber server, you can create a free one through
jabber.org or gmail.com.

Installation
============
If you're using Debian or a Debian-based Linux distribution (e.g.
Ubuntu), then something like this should suffice:

    sudo apt-get install ruby
    sudo gem install joggle

Configuration
=============
The simplest way to get Joggle up and running is like so:

    # save joggle jid/password in environment 
    export JOGGLE_JABBER_ID="joggle-example@example.com"
    export JOGGLE_PASSWORD="s3kr3t_"

    # run joggle
    joggle

Want to run Joggle via Cron?  Here's how:

    # save joggle jid/password in environment 
    JOGGLE_JABBER_ID="joggle-example@example.com"
    JOGGLE_PASSWORD="s3kr3t_"

    # run joggle every time the system is restarted
    @reboot joggle

Note: Although you can specify the JID and password via the
command-line, doing so is not recommended, particularly on a shared
system.

Using Joggle
============
In order to use Joggle you'll need to bind your Jabber account to your
twitter account.  Here's how:

 1. Add the Joggle Jabber ID to your IM client (e.g.
    joggle-example@example.com in the examples above).
 2. Register your Twitter account with Joggle by sending a 
    message to Joggle in the following form:

    ".register <twitter_user> <twitter_pass>"

    (replace <twitter_user> and <twitter_pass> with your Twitter
    username and password, respectively)

Note that more than one person can use the Joggle account.  Each person
just needs to follow the steps above (this feature can be disabled, see
the "Advanced Configuration" section below).  At the moment you can only
register one Twitter account per person, although this may change in the
future.

If you change your mind and decide not to use Joggle any more, you can
tell it to forget your Twitter account information by sending a message
like this:

    ".unregister"

There are several other commands available via message as well; use the
".help" command for a complete list.

Advanced Configuration
======================
TODO

  * removing automated registration
  * ignoring users

Security Concerns
=================
TODO

  * note about stored passwords
  * note about specifying user/pass on command-line
